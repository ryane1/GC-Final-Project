      The <span class="joyspan1">sun was blazing bright</span> on an early Saturday morning. My best friend Braylin and I <span class="joyspan1">decided to go on a road trip</span> to discover some hidden gems. Even though we only had enough money for a one day trip, we managed to stay on the road for days.

      My parents went on a vacation to Montego Bay and <span class="joyspan2">left the keys to their drop top coupe</span>, so we took the car because we wanted to <span class="joyspan2">ride out in style</span>. I hope they don’t read this story because they have no clue about our impromptu excursion...

      Of course our dogs, Daisy and Duke, had to join us. What’s a trip without your fur babies, right? <span class="joyspan3">Our trip needed to consist of three main things:</span> good food, content for our Instagram pages, and stores to shop in. Otherwise, we would be wasting our time.

      We hopped in the siren-red two-door car and <span class="joyspan4">began our mini adventure</span>. Khalid blared through the speakers and shades covered our eyes from the beaming sun rays. After hours spent on the highway, we noticed a sign that practically yelled <span class="joyspan4">“One Day Yoga Retreat, Remain Stress Free”</span> in bold letters.

      Everyone has what I like to call a “Zen-Friend”. They exude positivity, love Yankee Candles, and indulge in pilates twice a week. Yes, that is indeed Braylin. <span class="joyspan5">As her smile widened from excitement</span>, she demanded that we “needed to heighten our inner peace” and the dogs barked in agreement.

      I took the next exit to what looked like a <span class="joyspan6">psychedelic shack</span>. It was covered in bold and radiant colors like hot pink and yellow. We entered the building and immediately the smell of <span class="joyspan6">eucalyptus and mint leaves</span> flowed through my body.

      Despite my hesitation, I can admit that I felt more <span class="joyspan7">transformed</span> in one day than I did during my entire high school and college experience combined. The next day, after our mini Eat, Pray, Love excerpt, we were <span class="joyspan7">back on the road</span>.

      Our next stop was the Instagram approved <span class="joyspan8">Museum for Millenials</span>. It was a room full of different photo-worthy backgrounds that we would deliberately use to make it seem like we were <span class="joyspan8">international travelers</span>. We went to the Louvre, saw Drake in concert in London, and shopped in Milan in one hour.

      All of a sudden, <span class="joyspan9">I heard a phone ring</span> and when I realized it was my mom, I immediately threw my phone at Braylin and told her to tell my mom that I was in the bathroom. I was worried that she would hear the lie in my voice and prove my theory of all moms having <span class="joyspan9">telepathic senses</span> to be true.

      Braylin tossed the phone back my way and <span class="joyspan10">she was instantly demoted</span> from being my best friend to just a girl on a road trip with me. I accidentally answered the phone and my mom demanded that I come down for breakfast and take Daisy outside. At that very moment, I realized <span class="joyspan10">it was all a dream</span>!
