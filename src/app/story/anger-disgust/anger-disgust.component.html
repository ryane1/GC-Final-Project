        The alarm clock <span class="angerspan1">echoed loudly</span> in my ears
        for the third time. I sluggishly picked up my phone to snooze the
        annoying ringing, when I realized I had 30 minutes until my first
        meeting of the day with my team at work. My room was a
        <span class="angerspan1">complete disaster</span> from clothes being
        flung around aimlessly throughout the week. Have you ever heard of
        Speedy Gonzalez? That was me in human form.

        I darted back and forth across the room, looking for a presentable
        outfit. I settled for a button-up shirt and a pair of jeans. I
        <span class="angerspan2">sprinted to the kitchen counter</span> to grab
        my keys and discovered something terrible. My keys were missing! My face
        instantly <span class="angerspan2">turned red from anger</span> as I
        threw my bag on the floor. I searched high and low but no luck.

        All of sudden, Petey, my parrot, began yelling, “I’m hungry, I’m
        hungry”.
        <span class="angerspan3">I didn’t have time</span> to make him an
        assortment of fruits and vegetables like I normally do. Unfortunately, I
        had to give him the banana that I was planning to eat for breakfast. Now
        I had to face the fact that I was going to be
        <span class="angerspan3">late and hungry</span>. As I placed the small
        bowl of fruit in Petey’s cage, I noticed my car keys tucked away behind
        one of his toys.

        Fun fact: sometimes Petey likes to sneak out of his cage at night and
        <span class="angerspan4">wreak havoc</span> in the living room, then
        sneak back into his cage as if nothing happened. If you’re thinking
        about getting a parrot as a pet, just don’t! After I squinted my drowsy
        eyelids and stared the unphased Petey in his eyes for about 10 seconds,
        I <span class="angerspan4">slammed the front door</span> and headed
        towards the car.

        I revved up the engine and zoomed out the driveway. Surprisingly, I
        hadn’t received email notifications from my team about my tardiness. I
        dropped down onto the freeway and found myself stuck in
        <span class="angerspan5">bumper to bumper traffic</span>. I didn’t even
        bother to look at the time, to save myself from the
        <span class="angerspan5">torment of being extremely late</span>.
        Luckily, the traffic lightened up after a few minutes.

        I pulled into the parking lot and thought about a
        <span class="angerspan6">good excuse</span> to tell the team. Everyone
        loves a good animal story, so I decided to tell them that Petey flew
        outside and I had to practically
        <span class="angerspan6">save his life</span>. Sounds heart-warming,
        right?

        I frantically hopped out of the car and just when I thought the morning
        couldn’t get any worse, my phone slipped out of my hand.
        <span class="angerspan7">I yelled at the top of my lungs in rage</span>
        as I tried to save myself and the phone from immense agony.

        The gut-wrenching sound of my brand new phone hitting the pavement sent
        chills through my body. I felt like I was in that scene in every movie

        everything starts moving in slow motion. It was the worst feeling ever.

        On my way to the conference room, I noticed my co-worker casually
        sitting at his desk. I asked if I had missed the meeting and he said,
        “<span class="angerspan10">What meeting?</span>
        Are you talking about the one tomorrow?” with confusion. At that moment,
        I realized that I set my alarm for the wrong day.
        <span class="angerspan10">I was flabbergasted</span> by the turn of
        events.
