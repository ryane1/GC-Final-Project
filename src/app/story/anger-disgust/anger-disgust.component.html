      The night was <span class="angerspan1">cold and dreary</span>. I arrived to the island of Kathmandu with
      hopes of meeting my travel companion for an exciting excursion. Johnny and
      I were <span class="angerspan1">planning to hike</span> through lush green trees and bushes to the top of
      a well-known mountain.

      I usually don’t travel to remote islands <span class="angerspan2">alone</span>, but I decided to take the
      risk. I spent the night meeting the people of the town. Everything was
      going well until <span class="angerspan2">I was dared to eat a chocolate covered grasshopper</span>.

      While I admire Guy Fieri’s fearlessness to eat <span class="angerspan3">chicken toes and lizard arms</span>, I was not up for the challenge at all. However, I didn’t want to
      seem like a scaredy cat in front of my new friends, so I obliged. <span class="angerspan3">I closed my eyes in despair and chewed.</span>

      As I felt the bugs’ stiff <span class="angerspan4">legs crunch in my mouth</span>, I imagined that it was a handful of fresh, crispy fries from McDonald’s. Laughs echoed from the crowd as they witnessessed the expression of <span class="angerspan4">disgust</span> cover my face. Don’t eat grasshoppers in any way, shape, or form, I beg of you! Suddenly, the loud voices began to fade slowly.

      I opened my eyes and saw <span class="angerspan5">lightning bolts sketch the dark, black sky.</span> Everyone scattered in different directions. If you’re from Kathmandu, you
      know when it rains, it pours. As a visitor, I apparently didn’t get the
      memo. <span class="angerspan5">A thunderous cloud stood above my head and released a monsoon.</span>

      I <span class="angerspan6">frantically sprinted</span> towards the nearest place of shelter. The heavy wind blew so hard that it formed a blurry cast over my eyes. I felt like I was Tom Hanks in a scene from Cast Away. Out of nowhere, I saw <span class="angerspan6">dimmed headlights approaching me.</span> It was an old man driving a rickshaw.

      How he managed to drive through this <span class="angerspan7">treacherous weather</span> was beyond me. Honestly, I didn’t care because I just wanted help, even if it was from a
      <span class="angerspan7">stranger.</span> So I hopped on the rundown ride and proceeded to tell the driver where I stayed. He didn’t speak any English and could barely hear a word that I was saying.

      Frustratingly, I had no choice but to rely on my expert skills in
      Guesstures. After about 5 minutes of <span class="angerspan8">intense acting</span>, I had an epiphany! I remembered grabbing a card from the front desk of the hotel that I was staying at. I dug into my <span class="angerspan8">wet pockets</span> and pulled out the limp card.

      As soon as I showed him the card, he <span class="angerspan9">smiled and nodded</span> his head. I assumed that he knew the location of the hotel and I felt a sigh of relief. For an old guy, he was <span class="angerspan9">peddling quite fast</span>. I made it to my room in less than 15
      minutes.

      The next day, Johnny called me and said that his cat, Snuggles, got stuck
      on his roof and he couldn’t make it to the trip. <span class="angerspan10">I blame the downfall of this trip on the grasshopper!</span> In total anguish, I refused to stay on the island for another day. I decided to pack my bags and head back home to
      play Guesstures with my family.
